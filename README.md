# 🧠 Riya – Your Generative AI Assistant

Riya is a youthful, dynamic, and intelligent AI assistant built using cutting-edge generative AI tools. Developed during a Gen AI Workshop, Riya demonstrates the power of modern NLP and multimodal frameworks to create interactive and human-like AI assistants.

## 🔥 Features

- 💬 Conversational chatbot (Gradio Interface)
- 🤖 Personality-driven assistant (Riya – 21-year-old AI)
- 🌐 Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces
- ✨ User-friendly UI with branding and responsive layout
- 🎓 Built with practical exposure to GenAI tools

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Gradio** – for interactive frontend
- **OpenAI** – for large language model integration
- **Hugging Face** – deployment and model hosting
- **Google Colab** – prototyping and backend logic
- **LangChain** – (planned or integrated) for chaining LLM tasks
- **PlayHT** – for voice generation (optional or planned)

## 📚 What I Learned

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Add your OpenAI API key as a secret in Hugging Face Spaces:

1. Go to your Space → **Settings** → **Secrets**
2. Add the following:
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key_here
3. Upload `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and other necessary files.
4. The chatbot will auto-launch on build.

> 🛠️ **Note:** Without a valid OpenAI API key, the app will show an error or fail to respond.
## 🚀 Live Demo
👉 [Try on website](amulyaaichatbot.ccbp.tech)
👉 [Try Riya on Hugging Face](https://amulyaeamani-mygenaichatbot.hf.space)
> ⚠️ Currently shows error due to missing OpenAI API key.

## 📁 Files

- `app.py` – Main app logic  
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## 🛡️ Notes

- Do **not** hardcode API keys in your code.
- Always use secret variables in Spaces or `.env` files for safety.
